"""Execution layer for multi-step plans, with dynamic re-anchoring.

Each planned step is executed like this:

1. A fresh (1 s-floored) screen observation grounds the current UI.
2. The step's target is resolved from the *live* screen, in order:
   ``icon:name`` template match -> OCR text match (whole-word label or
   majority word overlap, so fragments such as ``none`` never match
   ``nonexistent``) -> planned bbox cropped
   from the planning-time screenshot and template-matched on the live frame.
   When several live controls match equally well -- two identical input boxes,
   the same label in a page and in a dialog -- the one nearest the point the
   plan named (its ``bbox`` centre, or its explicit ``x``/``y``) wins, so a
   repeated label can never send the caret to the wrong field.
3. The action is performed (cursor visibly moves unless teleporting).
4. The model can review the completed step and readiness of the next step in
   one request, choosing text or visual evidence as appropriate.
5. Failed steps are re-anchored and retried, then re-planned by the model
   (escalating to the smart tier), bounded by retry/budget guardrails and a
   signature-based loop detector.
6. Every successfully anchored step is compiled into a reusable reflex
   (template + metadata) stored in the memory cache.

The executor checks the stop event between every capture, LLM call and
action, so the kill hotkey aborts safely at the next step boundary.
