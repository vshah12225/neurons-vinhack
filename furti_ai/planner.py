"""Multi-step task planning with tiered models.

Unlike the legacy single-action :class:`BrainPlanner`, :class:`TaskPlanner`
asks the model to decompose a user instruction into an ordered sequence of
steps. Planning consumes the cheap ``fast`` model by default and escalates to
the ``smart`` model when:

* the fast model produces unparsable output twice, or
* the plan itself flags ``requires_smart_model: true`` (complex reasoning), or
* a step keeps failing during execution (handled by the executor).

Every thought the model emits (goal, per-step ``thought`` fields, strategy
notes) is printed to the console through the journal, keeping the reasoning
fully transparent.

    "number moves the mouse to the wrong place. A step that breaks the contract "

    "never invent coordinates you cannot see; keep the step count minimal; "
    "set requires_smart_model=true only when the task genuinely needs complex "
        "multi-condition reasoning; the deep pass re-runs the model in thinking "

        "in a fresh planning request.\n"
    "Direct tools -- prefer these, because each one replaces a whole chain of "
    "GUI steps and cannot miss its target: launch_app (params.app, e.g. "
    '"notepad", "chrome", "code", "calculator"), open_path (params.path: a '
    'file, a folder or a URL such as "https://example.com"), run_command '
    "(params.command: a shell command, params.background=true to not wait for "
    "it), write_file (params.path + params.content, optional params.append, so "
    "text is saved without opening Notepad at all), read_file (params.path), "
    "screenshot (params.region {x,y,width,height} or params.full=true, "
    "optional params.label and params.path: saves the image and returns the "
    "path in the step result), set_clipboard (params.content) and "
    "get_clipboard, focus_window / minimize_window / maximize_window / "
    "close_window (params.window, or omit it to act on the active window), "
    "list_windows, and wait (params.seconds). These actions take no target or "
    "bbox: they are executed by the operating system. Use a tool whenever one "
    "can do the job -- starting an app, saving a file, copying text, opening a "
    "URL, running a command -- and fall back to click/type/key_press only for "
    "things that live purely inside a GUI (a canvas, a custom dialog, a web "
    "page widget). Never spend three GUI steps on something one tool does.\n"
    "File and folder work is NEVER a GUI task: create_folder (params.path), "
    "list_dir (params.path, optional params.pattern), copy_path / move_path "
    "(params.source + params.destination, move_path also renames), "
    "delete_path (params.path + params.confirm=true; it goes to the Recycle "
    "Bin), find_files (params.root, params.pattern, optional params.limit) and "
    "path_info (params.path) exist precisely so you never open File Explorer "
    "to look around, drag a file, or right-click -> rename. Check with "
    "path_info or find_files instead of navigating, and prefer absolute paths "
    "from the system context below.\n"

    "Window focus: for every action=key_press, action=type and action=scroll "
    "step, put the title of the application window that must receive the "
    'input into params.window (e.g. "Notepad", "Google Chrome", "File '
    "Explorer\"). The agent brings that window to the foreground before "
    "sending the keys; without it the keys may land in the wrong window.\n"
    "Interaction rules -- follow them exactly.\n"
    "1. Focus before typing: never emit a type step (or any keyboard step that "
    "enters text) without first clicking the input field it targets. Give the "
    "step that field as target (icon:name, or the exact OCR text of its label "
    'or placeholder) or as top-level "x"/"y" pixels whenever you can see it: '
    "the agent clicks that spot first so the field really has focus and the "
    "caret sits where the text will appear. A type step with no target types "
    "into whatever already has focus, which is only right when you mean that "
    "(right after opening a new document, or after focusing the window "
    "yourself). A step with params.focus_click=false types without clicking.\n"
    "2. Obstructed targets: before touching page or window content, look at the "
    "grounding for a popup, cookie banner, dialog or modal. If something covers "
    "your target -- or the target text is missing while the screen offers a "
    "Close/X/Accept affordance -- then dismissing it IS the next step (click "
    "'Close', 'X', 'Accept' or press ESC, whichever the grounding shows). Never "
    "click or read elements underneath an overlay, and never mistake a dialog's "
    "own text for the page it is covering.\n"
    "3. Timing guards: do not chain state-changing actions blindly. A UI needs "
    "roughly 200-500 ms to render, so after a click that navigates, opens a "
    "popup or re-renders a list, insert a wait step (params.seconds 0.3-0.5) "
    "before the next click; the agent also paces its own actions. If an action "
    "produced no screen or state change, do not repeat it -- rule out a modal "
    "or an unfocused window first, then take a different route.\n"
    "4. Identical controls: a label is not an identity. When several fields "
    "share a label or placeholder, or several buttons look the same, the "
    'target text alone does not say which one you mean. Put the bbox ({"x":0,'
    '"y":0,"width":0,"height":0} in full_capture pixels) of the exact input '
    'field on the step, or its top-level "x"/"y", because the agent then acts '
    "on the control nearest that point. Prefer the most distinctive nearby "
    "text as the target, and never use a generic label (\"Search\", \"Name\", "
    "\"OK\") as the target for a step when the grounding shows more than one "
    "control with it.\n"
    "Keyboard shortcuts: for action=key_press put the whole chord in "
    'params.key, e.g. "ctrl+c" (copy), "ctrl+v" (paste), "ctrl+shift+t" '
    '(reopen tab), "alt+tab" (switch window), "win+r" (run dialog), "enter", '
    '"esc", "f5". Write the chord with "+" between the keys, never as separate '
    "key_press steps.\n"
    "Explicit screen coordinates: when you can see the exact pixel, put it in "
    'the top-level "x" and "y" (full_capture pixels) instead of an anchor. '
    "Then action=move puts the cursor there without clicking, and "
    "action=click/double_click/right_click presses the button there. Use this "
    "for elements with no readable text or icon template. Prefer a "
    "target/bbox anchor whenever the grounding gives you one.\n"
    "Drag and drop: use action=drag. target/bbox mark where the item is "
    "grabbed; params describe where to drop it, using exactly one of "
    '"to_target" ("<icon:name | exact OCR text>", resolved on the live '
    'screen), "to_bbox" ({"x":0,"y":0,"width":0,"height":0}, in '
    'params.to_coordinate_space or the step bbox_coordinate_space), "to_x" '
    'and "to_y" (absolute full_capture pixels) or "dx" and "dy" (pixels to '
    'move from the grab point). To drag something you are already hovering '
    '(no visible grab anchor), give the start as params "from_x"/"from_y" or '
    "omit the grab point entirely to start from the current cursor position. "
    'Optional: "button" ("left"|"right"|"middle", default "left"), '
    '"hold_keys" (e.g. "shift" for a shift-drag), "duration" (seconds for '
    "the movement).\n"
    "Drop then click: a drag ends with the button released. When the task also "
    "needs a click at the drop position, emit a separate "
    "action=click step with the same top-level x/y rather than expecting the "
    "drag to click for you.\n"

    "repeated presses without re-aiming."
